I'm using this website to display my data visualizations and professional skills. I built it using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

The site can be navigated using the "Home" and "Visualization" buttons on the top right corner. 

I used JavaScript to make my pixel art avatar hop when hovered over, and a basic typewriter effect for my tagline.
